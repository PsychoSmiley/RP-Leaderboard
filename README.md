## 📊 Methodology

Judge by `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5` on total of 325 points: 25 Yes/No (temp 0.0, realism, uncensored, logic, instruction following) + 3 Open-Ended scored 0-100 (temp 0.7, creative storytelling, character depth, worldbuilding, dialogue, narrative, immersion)

- Why LLM-as-judge works? Like agents, evaluating a story is easier than writing it, same as for humans.
- To evaluate E/RP we need to understand what defines it and know common issues to set specific criteria, but it isn't academic:
  - ✍️ Scope: E/RP scores turn-based POV responses vs EQ-Bench, where the focus is third-person stories.
  - 🔎 Targets: to found popular community models (e.g., Mythomax, still subject to preference/style/length biases-won't guarantee your taste).
  - ⚠️ Limitations: no multi-turn or long-term recall for simplicity, but open questions still lean toward the first message of a character instead of a full story; some models may exploit scoring criteria; judge uses a jailbreak for NSFW evaluation and may still refuse.
